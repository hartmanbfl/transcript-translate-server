- What is the Livestream setup for the church?
- Do they need this for one church or potentially several
    - could use namespaces for each church

- Which languages are represented in the attendees?
- Is this just for a church service or other situations as well?


How to get the service code into the server?
  - try setting in /auth call

Format of the channels that are subscribed to:
  - <service code:lang>

Subscribe for a transcript:
<service code>:"transcript"


Current Issues:
- stopping and restarting stream creates a duplicate/triplicate, etc. transcript stream

Typescript:
npm run tsc
